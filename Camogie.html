<p> St Maurs GAA fields over 11 camogie temas in Academy, U7, U8, U9, U10, U11, U12, U13, U15, and Minor! This is brilliant considering the size of the town, and each team has at least 18-25 players!</p>

<h2>Success</h2>
<p> In the last 3 years, Maurs has really taken a great peak in Camogie! in 2015, the U13 camogie team was undefeated in league and championship! In 2016 they made the Championship final a division higher than the year prior, and only lost out by a single point! In 2016 the U15 camogie team won the Division 2 county final against Erin's Isle, this was great result as when the wto teams met previously, it had ended in two draws and 1 win to the Finglas side. In 2017 the U15 team made the county semi finals but lost out by a point in extra time, however this team had gotten their glory by winning the league earlier in the year.

<h2> County Squads!</h2>
<p> Maurs have had great pride getting players onto underage county teams at under 12,13,14,15 and 16! Megan Benson and Maeve Bogan have made it right through from under 12 and Megan was the u16B camogie captain from the past season, and Aoife Bissett and Hazel Austin have both made it right from U12 to their current age group, U15!
